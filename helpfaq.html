            How to Play<br />
            1. Set Your Lineup:<br />
            Choose players to start each week. Drag and drop trading cards to
            fill positions like quarterback, running back, and wide receiver.<br />Keep an eye on player injuries or bye
            weeks!<br />
            2. Score Points:<br />Your players earn points based on their real-life performance in games (e.g.,
            touchdowns, rushing yards).<br />Monitor live scores through our Game Tracker.<br />
            3. Make Trades and
            Pickups:<br />Trade players with others in your league or add free agents to improve your roster.<br />
            4. Compete
            Weekly:<br />Face off against other league members. The team with the most points wins the matchup.<br />
            5. Win
            the League:<br />At the end of the season, the team with the best record or highest playoff performance is
            crowned champion.
